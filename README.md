# Weather-Dashboard
Challenge Module 06: Server-side APIs

Module 6 Challenge

A Weather Dashboard that gives current weather and a 5-Day forecast based on user input, and stores previous searches.
Had multiple issues with the API giving errors that may be have something to do with trying to use a free version. Had multiple tutoring and TA sessions resolving this, had the 5 day working, as of right now I'm still having issues, so I expect to come back to resolve the last of the 5-day forecast portion.
